This is 'yet another doc/docx/doc3' package for LaTeX code documetation (and demonstration). 
It is designed to be 'as class independent as possible', 
meaning: it makes no assumption about page layout (besides 'having a marginpar') or underline macros. 
Furthermore, it's assumed that \maketitle and the abstract environment 
were modified by the underline class, so alternatives (based on the article class) are provided. 

For more details, see the documentation, democodetools.pdf (source code: democodetools.tex)

The main idea is to be able to document  a package/class loading it first and then this package, 
making it possible not only to document the 'syntax' 
but also to show the end result 'as is' when using that other specific class/package.
